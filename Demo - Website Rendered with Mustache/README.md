# Handlebars Example

This mini-site is an example of how to use handlebars with hapi.

In this example we're just serving templates rendered handlebars, with little to no JS which is a very simple use case.

Hopefully this example illustrates how you could build an app, where in most apps you would populate the 
`context` variable passed to the templates with data from a database.

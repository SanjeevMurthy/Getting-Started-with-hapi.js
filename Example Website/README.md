# Example Website Built in hapi

This is a sample website built in hapi using the handlebars templating language. 

It is a similar to the main Getting Started with hapi.js website, except modified to be a multi-page site using the handlebars templating language to render each page instead of using the single page site structure you would see see on the main site. 

You can see the demo site in action here: https://getting-started-with-hapi-website-yuayhwvtkl.now.sh/, with thanks to [Zeit.co](zeit.co) for free open source hosting.
